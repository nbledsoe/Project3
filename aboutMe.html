    <p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
    <fieldset> 
      <p>My name is Nicholas Bledsoe, but I prefer to be called Nick. I am a sophmore ITM major with a passion for sports, computers, and video games. My family consists of my older brother, Carl, my older sister Jessica, mother Karen, and father Carl. I am currently the 3rd baseman for the Men's baseball team. I am from a suburb of Chicago about half a hour south of the city, called Crete. Ever since I was a little kid I have loved sports. Originally I began just playing football and baseball, but by the end of high school I was playing hockey and baseball. My passion for computers actually stems from my love of video games. Honestly I have never been a huge coder, but HTML is actually fun and entertaining to me. I'm excited to continue to learn and develop my skills.</p>
